        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A foolproof oven-baked salmon dish that is easy to make and big on flavor. If you don't like dill, you could try other fresh herbs, or even a mixture of dill, parsley, and spring onion.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup chopped fresh dill</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, finely minced, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspon ground coriander</li>
            <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 (2.5 pound) boneless salmon fillet</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine dill, olive oil, lemon juice, honey, garlic, coriander, salt, and pepper in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Rinse salmon fillet under running cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Lay salmon skin-side down on a large piece of plastic wrap. Spread dill mixture all over the top of the fish, wrap well with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
